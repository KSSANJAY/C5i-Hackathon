Reimagine Survey Analysis with AI

📌 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

✅ Git – for cloning the repository.

✅ Python (latest version recommended) – for running the scripts.

✅ Jupyter Notebook – for executing the .ipynb file.

✅ Pip – for managing Python packages.

✅ Any additional dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.


📦 REQUIREMENTS

Make sure to install the following dependencies:

📌 numpy==1.24.3 – Essential for numerical computing and handling arrays.

📌 pandas==1.5.3 – Provides data structures and analysis tools, especially useful for handling datasets.

📌 scikit-learn==1.2.2 – A machine learning library for data preprocessing, classification, regression, and clustering.

📌 imblearn==0.11.0 – Used for handling imbalanced datasets, particularly for oversampling and undersampling techniques.

📌 nltk==3.8.1 – A natural language processing toolkit useful for text-based data analysis.
